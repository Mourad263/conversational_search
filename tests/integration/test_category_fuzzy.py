"""Permanent regression coverage for category AND brand resolution
(English + Arabic) in the keyword-search parser, turning the full
catalog-wide verification sweep (research.md) into automated tests so a
future change can't silently regress it.

Covers, matching what was actually verified against the real catalog and
the real end-to-end parser (parse_keyword_query, the same code path a
real user query hits -- not an isolated internal function):
1. Every real category name AND every real brand name in the catalog, in
   three forms each: (a) correctly spelled alone, (b) with a single
   realistic typo, (c) combined with a real brand/category that actually
   co-occurs with it in the catalog data, in both word orders. Asserts
   each bucket's pass rate doesn't regress below its measured baseline,
   and lists every individual failure by name if it does.
2. The root-cause fixes found via that sweep: a fuzzy-match tie-break bug
   that fragmented multi-word brand names ("Aqua Delta" -> just "Aqua"),
   category and brand competing for the same text instead of one blindly
   running before the other ("Ahmed Tea" losing "Tea" to the category
   matcher), and the SearchAdapter vector-fusion bug that let irrelevant
   same-brand products flood results when free text combined with a
   brand filter ("لانشون اطياب" returning all 71 Atyab products instead
   of the 9 genuine luncheon matches).
3. The confirmed false-positive collisions (a generic/brand word
   coincidentally scoring >= threshold against an unrelated real
   category or brand), each with its own assertion.
4. The specific real queries already discussed, with their exact
   verified expected values.
