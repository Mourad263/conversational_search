#     GARBAGE / NONSENSE (10): 0.3046 "margarin"->Tomato Paste, 0.3167
#         "لانشن"->Body Lotion, 0.3178 "زذأزذأزذأ", 0.3283 "حليبب"->Lip

# The groups nearly separate: worst genuine 0.2976 < best garbage 0.3046.
# 0.31 sits above that boundary deliberately -- it keeps all 13 genuine
# rescues with a 0.0124 margin on the case this path exists for, at the
# cost of letting the single marginal "margarin" (0.3046) through. A
# tighter 0.30 would also catch that one, but leaves only 0.0024 of margin
# above "milq", so an unseen genuine rescue landing just past it would be
# silently killed -- the worse failure of the two. NOT a clean, wide gap;
# it is a narrow one chosen to fail on the permissive side. Still far
# better separated than the brand-filtered flooding case (adapter.py),
# where genuine and irrelevant distances were fully interleaved and NO
# cutoff could have separated them at all.
