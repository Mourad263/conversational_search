# Word-level spelling correction for query terms that have zero literal
# BM25 matches (research.md) -- same rapidfuzz/threshold philosophy as
# brand/category fuzzy matching, but the correction VOCABULARY is
# index.postings itself (real tokens from actual product names), since
# that's exactly what a re-run of rank() can act on -- a category-only
# word wouldn't help here even if it scored well.
#
# SPELLING_CORRECTION_THRESHOLD=80 alone is not enough on this vocabulary:
# it's 24,544 tokens (vs. ~1,691 brands/~488 categories), and includes
# thousands of short, rare fragments (numbers, abbreviations, one-off
# typos already baked into some product's own name). Confirmed directly:
# "milq" (typo of "milk") scores 85.7 against the real word "mil" -- a
# 3-letter fragment appearing in just 2 unrelated products -- HIGHER than
# 75.0 against "milk" itself (648 docs), because rapidfuzz's ratio
# rewards a same-length deletion over a same-length substitution for very
# short strings. Score threshold cannot separate these two cases: a
# genuine correction ("crakers"->"cracker", "جبنن"->"جبن") scores the
# identical 85.7.
#
# SPELLING_CORRECTION_MIN_TARGET_DOCS=3 (the correction target must
# appear in at least this many real products) is the signal that does
# separate them -- confirmed directly against the real index: every
# genuine correction found in testing has >=3 docs (lowest observed:
# "halloumii"->"halloumi" at exactly 3, "freekehh"->"freekeh" at 4), while
# the "milq"->"mil" false positive has only 2. This is a narrow, not a
# wide, margin (3 vs. 2) -- disclosed honestly, not claimed clean: a
# handful of confirmed remaining false positives exist where an unrelated
# but genuinely common real word coincidentally out-scores the intended
# target (e.g. "تشيس" (typo of تشيز/cheese) -> "تشويس" (Choice, a real
# brand, 90 docs), and "edammame" (typo of edamame, not itself in the
# vocabulary) -> "medamme" (foul medammes, a real, unrelated dish, 12
# docs)) -- the same class of inherent edit-distance limitation already
# accepted for brand/category matching and the vector-fallback floor, not
# something a threshold/floor tweak can fully close.
