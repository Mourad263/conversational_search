"""System A: the traditional keyword-search baseline (FR-014, tasks.md T048).

Takes a plain typed string -- no structured FilterSet handed in -- and does
NAIVE literal/regex parsing to pull out a price range and an exact category
name mention if present, then calls the same SearchAdapter every other
system uses. Deliberately dumb: recognizes a fixed set of literal price
phrases in both English ("under 50", "between 20 and 40") and Arabic
("تحت 55", "بين 20 و 40") -- this is still literal phrase matching, not
query understanding (e.g. a typo'd price word, or a phrasing not in the
fixed list, is not recognized). Category name matching (English and
Arabic) is literal substring/token matching too. Brand is resolved purely
from q's free text as well -- same as category/price, there is no
dedicated brand= parameter -- but via fuzzy/typo-tolerant matching
(rapidfuzz) against Sprint 0's canonicalized brand list rather than exact
substring matching, since a real misspelled brand mention ("glaxy",
"munshi") is common and a hard substring match would miss it entirely.

    (longest tier first) so a multi-word name (e.g. 'Meat & Poultry') is

    longer tier match always wins outright, regardless of where in the
    text it falls. Returns (matched_slug_or_None,
    text_with_the_matched_phrase_removed, matched_word_count) -- removal
    matters: leaving a recognized category/brand name in the leftover
    free-text would make it ALSO a required BM25 text-match term, silently
    causing false zero-results (e.g. 'meat under 100' would then require
    the literal word 'meat' in a matching product's title, on top of the
    category filter). The word count lets the caller compare this match's
    specificity against a competing brand match over the same text.

    Sprint 5 Part 3: within a tier, if MULTIPLE different candidates all
    match (different words, same word-count -- e.g. both 'لبن' -> milk and
    'الشوفان' -> oats are real, valid single-word exact category names

    candidate-list order (an incidental DB row order that reflects
    nothing about the query itself -- confirmed via a real query where it
    picked the wrong side of a real compound concept purely by chance).

    Which direction depends on the query's language, because Arabic and
    English compound nouns put their head noun in OPPOSITE positions:
    Arabic idafa ('لبن الشوفان' = 'milk of oats') and adjective-follows-
    noun constructions put the head FIRST, so Arabic text prefers the
    LEFTMOST match. English noun-noun compounds are right-headed ('cream
    cheese' is a CHEESE, 'chocolate milk' is a MILK, 'milk chocolate' is a
    CHOCOLATE -- the second word names the category, the first modifies
    it), so non-Arabic text prefers the RIGHTMOST match. This is evidence-
    backed, not assumed: a first version always preferred leftmost, which
    correctly fixed the Arabic oat-milk case but was PROVEN wrong for
    English by a real, common product -- 'cream cheese' resolved to
    category=cream_11677 (leftmost 'cream') with a hard-filter leftover of
    'cheese', returning ZERO results, even though the real products (e.g.
    'Kiri Cream Cheese') are catalogued under 'cheese'; the awkward
    reversed phrasing 'cheese cream' accidentally worked by the same
    leftmost rule, which is the wrong way around. Reuses the existing
    is_arabic() helper (already used by _normalize_for_fuzzy) rather than
    adding new language detection. This only ever activates on a true
    same-length tie -- a single matching candidate in a tier is returned

    """Shared typo/near-miss tolerant matcher (rapidfuzz edit-distance
    ratio) used by both brand and category detection -- same algorithm,
    different candidate lists/thresholds/blocklists. candidates:
    [(slug, [norm_form_0, norm_form_1, ...]), ...], one normalized form
    per entry in window_transforms -- transform[i] applied to the window
    is scored against norm_forms[i], and the BEST score across all pairs
    wins (not just one fixed transform): category needs this because
    always stripping the Arabic definite article "ال" helps a query
    that's missing it entirely ('بسكوت' vs 'البسكويت') but HURTS a query
    that already has it, since stripping shortens an already-short word
    and makes an ordinary one-character typo in it fail threshold that it
    wouldn't have otherwise -- confirmed via a full regression sweep
    (research.md), not assumed. Scans every contiguous query word window
    (up to max_phrase_words); a blocklisted window (its default,
    untransformed form) never matches, regardless of score. Only the
    default (identity) form is used to reconstruct the returned remaining
    text, so leftover free text elsewhere in the query is never altered
    by a transform.

    Ties prefer the LONGER window, not whichever is scored first: found
    via a real bug -- a real 2-word brand ('Aqua Delta', 'Big Babol',
    'Dabur Amla', 'Fresh Days'...) was getting chopped down to a
    DIFFERENT, shorter, also-real brand ('Aqua', 'Big', 'Dabur', 'Fresh')
    because both scored a tied 100.0 and the shorter window is generated
    first. Same principle _extract_first_phrase_match already applies for
    exact matching (sorts candidates longest-phrase-first) -- fuzzy
    matching needs the same preference, just enforced as a tie-break
    here since scores (not just presence/absence of a match) are involved.

    word_exclusions_norm (Sprint 5 Part 2): unlike blocklist_norm, which
    only blocks a window whose FULL normalized text exactly equals a
    blocklisted phrase, this disqualifies any window that CONTAINS one of
    these words at all, regardless of window length or what else is in
    it. Deliberately kept separate and used sparingly (only for
    functional/grammatical words like "بدون" that could never
    legitimately be part of a real multi-word brand name, or for a
    caller-computed, per-call set of words with stronger exact-match
    evidence elsewhere) -- applying it broadly would break real brands
    that legitimately contain an ordinary product word ("My Meat", "Ahmed
    Tea", "Coffee Break", "Mc Sauce" -- see parse_keyword_query's own
    docstring), which must still be free to win fairly via the normal
    length-based competition.

    protected_words_norm (Sprint 5 Part 2): softer than
    word_exclusions_norm -- a window containing one of these words is not
    disqualified outright, only held to protected_threshold instead of
    the normal (lower) threshold. Used for words that ALREADY have their
    own real, authoritative catalog evidence (an exact category-name
    match on the leftover text -- see _protected_category_words) that a
    merely-plausible fuzzy brand coincidence shouldn't override, while
    still letting a genuinely near-exact/exact real brand name win (a
    full regression sweep found this distinction matters: "milk" scores
    only 88.9 against the coincidentally-similar real brand "Milka" --
    correctly blocked -- but "Hero" is ITSELF a real, exact brand name
    (scores 100) that also happens to collide with an unrelated real
    category also called "Hero" -- a blanket exclusion wrongly blocked
    this genuine brand too; the score gap between a coincidental
    resemblance and an actual exact/near-exact name is exactly what
    separates the two cases).

    Sprint 6: ALWAYS (no caller wiring needed) also raises a window to
    protected_threshold when the window's own words have strong REAL
    PRODUCT-CORPUS co-occurrence support (_corpus_cooccurrence_support >=
    _MIN_PRODUCT_COOCCURRENCE_SUPPORT) -- catalog-grounded evidence that
    the window is itself genuine, ordinary product language, not just a
    coincidentally-similar string. Found via real, fresh-session queries:
    "paste" (69 real products) scores exactly 80.0 against the unrelated
    category "Pasta"; "peas" (46 real products) scores 88.9 against the
    unrelated real brand "Pears"; "frozen peas" (12 real products contain
    both words) scores 81.8 against the unrelated category "Frozen Meat"
    purely because both phrases share the word "frozen". This is the
    exact same principle as protected_words_norm above, just with a
    different (corpus-frequency, not category-name-exactness) source of
    evidence.

    This protection is then PER-CANDIDATE exempted (via
    candidate_product_ids + _corpus_overlap_ratio) when the window's own
    real-product evidence substantially OVERLAPS that specific
    candidate's real product membership -- i.e. the window isn't just
    "a real word", it's specifically real evidence FOR this candidate,
    meaning it's a genuine spelling/grammar variant of the SAME entity,
    not a coincidence. This distinction could NOT be made by score alone:
    "جهينة" (a real spelling variant of the real brand alias "جهينه") and
    "detergent" (singular of the real category "Detergents") score 80.0
    and 94.7 respectively against their TRUE targets -- scores that
    overlap the SAME range as the confirmed coincidences above, since
    edit-distance ratio can't tell "same word, different spelling" apart
    from "different word, coincidentally similar spelling" (paste/pasta
    and جهينة/جهينه are both single-character-different, same length).
    89-90% (جهينة) down to 43% (كامل+الدسم vs its own category) of these
    genuine variants' real supporting products are ALSO real instances of
    the matched candidate, while all 3 confirmed coincidences above are
    at exactly 0% -- a large, clean, measured gap.

    A genuinely near-exact/exact real brand or category name (e.g.
    "Extra" typed alone, or a real typo like "milqa") is unaffected by
    either mechanism, since typos have ~0 corpus support and real short
    brand names are still free to win at protected_threshold or above."""
