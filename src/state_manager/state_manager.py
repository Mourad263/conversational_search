"""Sprint 3 State Manager (tasks.md T027/T033/T034): deterministic,
non-LLM per-session filter state, updated turn over turn from the
`intent` already classified by the Understanding layer
(src/understanding/llm.py) and the FilterSet already resolved by
Validation (src/validation/validate.py).

Deliberately contains no LLM judgment. Whether a turn continues the
active search or starts a new one is decided upstream -- the Understanding
LLM sees a bounded conversation-history window (llm.py's HISTORY_WINDOW)
precisely so that judgment is already baked into `action.intent` by the
time it reaches here. Applying it is then pure bookkeeping:

- search / reset -> discard prior state, keep only this turn's resolved
  values (an empty FilterSet for a bare "start over"/"reset" with nothing
  else said, or a fresh set of filters for "start over, show me
  chocolate").
- add_filter / modify_filter -> merge this turn's non-null resolved
  values into the existing state, leaving every other field untouched.
  Whether a field that changes was previously empty ("add") or already
  had a value ("modify") is otherwise a UX distinction, not a different
  merge rule -- except for one price-only case: modify_filter changing
  just one bound past the OTHER, still-retained bound clears that stale
  bound instead of constructing an invalid FilterSet (see apply()).
- remove_filter -> clear exactly the field named by
  `action.target_facet` (schema.py), leaving the rest untouched. If
  target_facet is null (the LLM couldn't tell which filter was meant),
  this is a safe no-op -- state is left unchanged rather than guessing
  what to clear.
